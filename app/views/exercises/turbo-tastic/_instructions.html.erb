  <p>It's Turbo Time!</p>

    So this is a bit of an odd exercise where I'm going to suggest we look for a
    way to do this <em>without</em> using Stimulus. Weird for a Stimulus
    Workshop, I know.
  </p>

  <p>
    When using Turbo, we should be aware of all the things that are achievable
    using Turbo, including excuting client-side code from our server-side code.
    Sometimes it will seem like Stimulus is the tool to reach for, but sometimes
    we should consider using Turbo as an alternative.

  <p>
    We have a list of people who have access to this workshop, but we want to
    invite more. We can add an email address and click invite and it will add
    them to the invitations list. This is Turbo doing it's thing.
  </p>

  <p>
    Annoyingly, when I click on Invite, the email address I just invited stays
    in the input field. When I go to invite the next person I first have to
    clear out the previous email.
  </p>

  <p>
    Can you clear out the invitation input when I send an invitation so I can
    quickly send the next one?
