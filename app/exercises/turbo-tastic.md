It's Turbo Time!

So this is a bit of an odd exercise where I'm going to suggest we look for a way
to do this *without* using Stimulus. Weird for a Stimulus Workshop, I know.

When using Turbo, we should be aware of all the things that are achievable using
Turbo, including excuting client-side code from our server-side code. Sometimes
it will seem like Stimulus is the tool to reach for, but sometimes we should
consider using Turbo as an alternative.

We have a list of people who have access to this workshop, but we want to invite
more. We can add an email address and click invite and it will add them to the
invitations list. This is Turbo doing it's thing.

Annoyingly, when I click on Invite, the email address I just invited stays in
the input field. When I go to invite the next person I first have to clear out
the previous email.

Can you clear out the invitation input when I send an invitation so I can
quickly send the next one?
