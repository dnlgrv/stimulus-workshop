Well well well. We've all been faced with this particular challenge before
haven't we. It's time for tabs! Though not quite tabs in the same way as the box
this text is written in... but you can take a look at that later.

We've already got some predefined HTML and a controller set up ready for this.

We're going to want to manage some kind of state (like which tab is selected),
and then determine how to to show/hide each tab's content.
