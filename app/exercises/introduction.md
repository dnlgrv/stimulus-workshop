Ahoy! Just a quick introduction to the workshop app and format.

The workshop is split into multiple different exercises, each of which try to
present a practical problem that can be solved using Stimulus.

Make edits directly to the application code using your editor of choice and
refresh to see the changes. This is just a regular Rails app, so modify it as
you see fit.

This workshop is not trying to be a replacement for reading the
[Handbook](https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/handbook/introduction) and
[Reference](https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/reference/controllers). The Stimulus
website is a great place to refer back to as you learn more or need a reminder.

Shout out questions and make suggestions! There are a lot of different
approaches you can use for each of the exercises.
